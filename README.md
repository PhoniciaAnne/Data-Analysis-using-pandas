## Introduction

Pandas is a powerful and easy-to-use data analysis and data manipulation library for Python. This repository provides practical examples and tutorials to help you get started with pandas and demonstrate its capabilities in handling real-world data analysis tasks.

## Features

- Data loading and inspection
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Data transformation and manipulation
- Statistical analysis and summary
- Data visualization with pandas

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** The programming language used.
- **pandas:** The main library used for data analysis.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Data-Analysis-using-pandas.git

  **Navigate to Directory:**
       
      
    cd Data-Analysis-using-pandas

** Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
           `python3 -m venv ven`
          source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
## Usage
**Activate the virtual environment (if you created one):**

     source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
